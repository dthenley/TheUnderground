The current status of the website is in the first phase of the alpha stage. All pages are built with artificial content so as to give a clith through alpha launch. The chat page is not up and running through the github page but I have customized it to fit the theme of the website. None of the databases have been compiled, so the log in function and the ability to make a different profile are not enabled as of yet. All comments and bugs can be left in the discussion board until I can facilitate a better place for them. The cut off date for comments will be May 19. The Beta site will be up and fully functional by next Thursday, it will be fully functional with the ability to create a user account that will log you straight into chat.
